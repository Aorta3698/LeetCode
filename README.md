# My LeetCode Solutions

I've solved 2200+ Leetcode problems between Oct 2021 - Sept 2022 and here they are. 

I don't think I have all 2200+ here just because I've been coding on LeetCode editor instead of my Vim editor.

I have yet updated some of really old solutions, so the qualities of codes may vary.

I solved about 2000 LC questions in Java and the reminder in C++. 

# Is It Worth It?

I have no way to tell right now. As we are in a tech recession now, all the interviews that I managed to get don't ask LC questions. 

# Why Did I Do It?

For fun. I went from not knowing basic Java syntax and basic data structure (like HashMap) to solving 2200+ LC questions and Guardian contest level (highest) in exactly 12 months.

I guess it takes a special kind of passion to be able to do that.

# Is Switching to C++ Worth It?

I guess so. Most of the interviews for SWE/SDE internships I got are because I have experiences in C++.
